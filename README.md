# text-to-emotion-recognition
A Natural Language Processing project focused on text-to-emotion recognition using the Kaggle Emotion Dataset. We explored traditional embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe) and transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa), including fine-tuning and ensemble approaches to classify text into six emotion categories.
